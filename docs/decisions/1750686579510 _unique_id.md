# Decision Record: Unique ID Generation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Selecting the appropriate identifier strategy is critical for Metrature's scalability, performance, and data consistency. We evaluated UUID, CUID, and ULID options for our distributed system.

## Decision

Adopt ULIDs as our primary identifier format across the Metrature platform with a structured prefix pattern.

## Rationale

### ULID Advantages

1. **Time-based Sorting & DB Performance**
   - 48-bit timestamp prefix enables natural chronological sorting
   - Better B-tree index utilization with sequential inserts vs. random UUIDs
   - Reduced index fragmentation and improved query performance

2. **URL-friendly & Readable Format**
   - Crockford's Base32 encoding: URL-safe, no special characters
   - Compact representation (26 chars vs UUID's 36 chars)
   - Avoids confusing character pairs (0/O, 1/I/l)

3. **High Uniqueness & Distributed Generation**
   - 80 bits of entropy with extremely low collision probability
   - Supports monotonic generation to maintain time ordering
   - No central coordination required for ID generation

### Comparison with Alternatives

**UUID (v4)**:
- Random ordering hinders database efficiency

- Longer representation (36 chars with hyphens)
- Well-established with broad ecosystem support

**UUID (v7)**:
- Similar time-based ordering but less library support
- Lacks URL-friendly encoding of ULIDs

**CUID**:
- Client-side focused without millisecond timestamps
- Doesn't ensure lexicographical sorting matches creation time

## Implementation Details

- Using ULID library (v3.0.1) with consistent ID generation service
- Database columns optimized for ULID storage (CHAR(26))
- Prefix structure applied to all identifiers

### ID Prefix Structure

Format: `{region_code}{environment_code}{entity_code}_{ulid}`

- **region_code**: Geographic region (e = Europe, a = Asia, n = North America)
- **environment_code**: Deployment environment (p = Production, s = Staging, d = Development)
- **entity_code**: Entity type (u = User, o = Organization, t = Team)

**Examples**:
- `epu_01H5ZXCYDRJZS7K70NSKAWVSCA`: User in Europe Production
- `nso_01H5ZXPSABCDEF123456789012`: Organization in North America Staging

This structure enables instant visual identification, resource filtering, and maintains sorting capabilities.

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Better database performance through optimized indexing
- Natural time sorting without extra metadata
- No coordination needed for distributed generation

**Negative**:
- Less universal recognition than UUIDs
- Some external systems might expect traditional UUIDs
